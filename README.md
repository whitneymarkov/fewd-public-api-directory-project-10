# fewd-public-api-directory-project-10
Using JavaScript, create an employee directory by communicating with a third-party API.

Use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and use that data to build a prototype for an employee directory. Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name should open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
